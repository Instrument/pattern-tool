# pattern-tool
A simple tool for adding patterns to a Pattern Lab project

### Getting started
Install the tool via npm.
`npm i pattern-tool`

To add a new pattern to your patternlab project follow these steps:
- `cd` into the folder where you want to create a new project via the command line.
- `pattern add [fileName]` will add all the new pattern files (`.md`, `.mustache`, `.scss`, and `.feature`). For example to add a `button` component you would use the command `pattern add button`.
